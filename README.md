# Weekly Goal Tracker
A multi-platform application that involves making weekly notes - summaries of "what I am proud of this week" and comparing them to one, the most important, on which you have your long-term goals recorded. This gives insight into whether you are heading in the right direction with your actions.
The idea for the application came from the fact that most of the available applications that help in achieving goals, motivation, and planning, are either too complex and therefore, in my opinion, distracting, or force the user to use it daily - that's why I often saw empty fields in the "statistics" which made me a bit sad and demotivated. In this way, I thought I would do something similar but not requiring daily activity, with a simple interface and minimal functionalities.

This is my first Flutter project btw.

## Project
Mobile applications are applications, let's call it, of first contact with the user. Everything starts at the visual layer, behind which hides the logical layer. Especially in the case of this particular application.

This is my UI protoptype made with Figma:

The idea was simple: a navigation bar and two screens—one with the date and a note describing the successes of the week, and another with the same note attached to a description of long-term goals being pursued. Initially, I thought that the weekly note would only be editable on the first screen, "Notepad," while "Milestones" would be a locked twin copy of the entered text. Later, I realized that it didn't make sense and was inconvenient—editing the weekly note should be possible wherever the note is visible.

*On the design, both screens have a cogwheel icon in the top right corner. Application settings and other interesting features that could be added in the future will be described in the "Ideas for Further Development" section.*
